The challenge is to flexibly control an arbitrary number of agents while achieving effective collaboration. Existing MARL methods usually suffer from the trade-off between these two considerations. To address the issue, we propose a novel architecture that learns a spatial joint representation of all the agents and outputs grid-wise actions. Each agent will be controlled independently by taking the action from the grid it occupies. By viewing the state information as a grid feature map, we employ a convolutional encoder-decoder as the policy network. This architecture naturally promotes agent communication because of the large receptive field provided by the stacked convolutional layers. Moreover, the spatially shared convolutional parameters enable fast parallel exploration that the experiences discovered by one agent can be immediately transferred to others. The proposed method can be conveniently integrated with general reinforcement learning algorithms, e.g., PPO and Q-learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in extensive challenging multi-agent tasks in StarCraft II.}

  abstract = {We investigate the problem of cooperative multirobot planning in unknown environments, which is important in numerous applications in robotics. The research community has been actively developing belief space planning approaches that account for the different sources of uncertainty within planning, recently also considering uncertainty in the environment observed by planning time. We further advance the state of the art by reasoning about future observations of environments that are unknown at planning time. The key idea is to incorporate within the belief indirect multi-robot constraints that correspond to these future observations. Such a formulation facilitates a framework for active collaborative state estimation while operating in unknown environments. In particular, it can be used to identify best robot actions or trajectories among given candidates generated by existing motion planning approaches, or to refine nominal trajectories into locally optimal paths using direct trajectory optimization techniques. We demonstrate our approach in a multi-robot autonomous navigation scenario and consider its applicability for autonomous navigation in unknown obstacle-free and obstacle-populated environments. Results indicate that modeling future multirobot interaction within the belief allows to determine robot actions (paths) that yield significantly improved estimation accuracy.},

We have also proposed a sharing method between robots in multi robot exploration. In our method, the belief measure is used as the explored information in each robot. Then, each robot has grid maps for storing explored information and for sharing information explored by other robots. However, each robot moves randomly and cannot explore efficiently. Therefore, this paper deals with a determination method of exploring points in multi robot exploration. In this method, each robot can determine exploring points considering the belief measures. The key point of this method is that robots have not a common map and determine exploring points independently.

  abstract = {Swarms of tiny flying robots hold great potential for exploring unknown, indoor environments. Their small size allows them to move in narrow spaces, and their light weight makes them safe for operating around humans. Until now, this task has been out of reach due to the lack of adequate navigation strategies. The absence of external infrastructure implies that any positioning attempts must be performed by the robots themselves. State-of-the-art solutions, such as simultaneous localization and mapping, are still too resource demanding. This article presents the swarm gradient bug algorithm (SGBA), a minimal navigation solution that allows a swarm of tiny flying robots to autonomously explore an unknown environment and subsequently come back to the departure point. SGBA maximizes coverage by having robots travel in different directions away from the departure point. The robots navigate the environment and deal with static obstacles on the fly by means of visual odometry and wall-following behaviors. Moreover, they communicate with each other to avoid collisions and maximize search efficiency. To come back to the departure point, the robots perform a gradient search toward a home beacon. We studied the collective aspects of SGBA, demonstrating that it allows a group of 33-g commercial off-the-shelf quadrotors to successfully explore a real-world environment. The application potential is illustrated by a proof-of-concept search-and-rescue mission in which the robots captured images to find ``victims'' in an office environment. The developed algorithms generalize to other robot types and lay the basis for tackling other similarly complex missions with robot swarms in the future. A minimal navigation solution is presented for swarms of tiny flying robots to explore unknown, GPS-denied environments.

This may mean that there are adversarial agents in the environment trying to disable the robots, or that some regions of the environment tend to make the robots fail, for example due to radiation, fire, adverse weather, or caustic chemicals. A probabilistic model of the environment is formulated, under which recursive Bayesian filters are used to estimate the environment events and hazards online. The robots must control their positions both to avoid sensor failures and to provide useful sensor information by following the analytical gradient of mutual information computed using these online estimates. Mutual information is shown to combine the competing incentives of avoiding failure and collecting informative measurements under a common objective. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the algorithm.},

In the past, many approaches have used occupancy grid maps to represent the environment during the map building process. Occupancy grids, however, are based on the assumption that each cell is either occupied or free. In this paper we introduce coverage maps as an alternative way of representing the environment of a robot. Coverage maps store for each cell of a given grid a posterior about the amount the corresponding cell is covered by an obstacle. We also present a model that allows us to update coverage maps upon input obtained from proximity sensors. We furthermore describe how to use coverage maps for a decision theoretic approach to exploration. Finally we present experimental results illustrating that coverage maps can be used to efficiently learn highly accurate models even if noisy sensors such as ultrasounds are used.},
